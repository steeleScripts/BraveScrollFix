# BraveScrollFix
A simple script that enables the middleclick scroll feature for Brave Browser on Manjaro/Arch based Linux

The script checks to see if the brave browser desktop configuration file has been updated with the middleclick scroll flag and if not it adds it in using sed. The script could be ran as a cron job or included in your exiting update scripts.
